# Rename Selected Images

Sometimes you have placed images with weird names, e.g. directly from the camera.

![wrong names](./pix/InDesign012.jpg)

Select one or more of those images and run the script.

If the selection contains a graphic AND the graphic is linked AND the link has a 'normal' status THEN the script asks for a new name.

![new name](./pix/InDesign013.jpg)

Default for the prompt is the current name, thus if you cancel or just hit enter, nothing happens.

![no change](./pix/InDesign014.jpg)

The changes can not be undone by CMD-Z, because InDesign can only undo its own actions.


## Installation

### Basic Installation

1. Open the Scripting Panel

2. Right-click the entry "User" and select "Reveal in Finder".

3. Place script in folder "Scripts Panel"

### Startup Scripts

Some scripts are declared as "Startup Scripts". These are scripts that are automatically run, right after InDesign starts.

For those simply create a folder with the name "Startup Scripts" right beside the "Scripts Panel" folder and place the script inside.

### Storing scripts somewhere else

The "Scripts Panel" folder is located in preferences folder of your current InDesign-Version.

I have installed several versions of InDesign (since the customer and his version is "always right" ;) ) but I want to have a single installation folder that is shared among the InDesign-versions.

It used to be that an alias was good enough for this purpose but that changed a few years ago. Now you need something that is called a [symbolic link](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115646/how-can-i-create-a-symbolic-link-in-terminal).

1. Find the Terminal in Application:Utilities:
1. Open the folder that contains the folder where you want to store your scripts
1. Drag the folder-symbol in the window bar onto the Terminal

![open folder in terminal](https://www.cuppascript.com/stuff/readme_pix/install/04-open-terminal.jpg)

By dragging the folder onto the terminal that folder is automatically set as 'current folder' so you don’t have to bother about paths.

4. Now type `ln -s nameofsourcefolder nameofsymboliclink`

In my example:

``` bash
ln -s my\ real\ scripts\ folder/ my-scripts
```

![symbolic link](https://www.cuppascript.com/stuff/readme_pix/install/05-link.jpg)

5. Drag the link (here: `my-scripts`) into your "Scripts Panel" folder

### Folder Structure

Instead of simply putting all your scripts flat into the Scripts Panel you can create a folder structure.

![folders](https://www.cuppascript.com/stuff/readme_pix/install/06-structure.jpg)

The Scripts panel will show the same structure:
